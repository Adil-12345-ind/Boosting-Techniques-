        " - Boosting in machine learning is an ensemble technique that combines multiple weak learners (models that perform slightly better than random guessing) to form a strong learner with high accuracy.\n",

        "✅ What is Boosting?\n",
        "\n",
        "Boosting is an iterative process where:\n",
        "\n",
        "Models are trained sequentially.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each new model focuses more on the errors (misclassified points) of the previous models.\n",
        "\n",
        "The predictions of all models are weighted and combined to produce the final output.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key idea: “Turn weak learners into a strong learner by giving more weight to hard-to-predict instances.”\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ How Does Boosting Work? (Step-by-Step)\n",
        "\n",
        "Start with a base model (usually a simple model like a decision stump — a 1-level decision tree).\n",
        "\n",
        "Train on the data and calculate errors.\n",

        "\n",
        "A weak learner is slightly better than random (e.g., 51% accuracy).\n",
        "\n",
        "By iteratively correcting mistakes and giving higher weight to hard cases, the ensemble learns patterns that a single weak learner cannot.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mathematically, error reduces exponentially with the number of boosting rounds (if base learner performs slightly better than random).\n",
